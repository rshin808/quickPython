#Syntax  
##Comments  
Comments in python can be written with # followed by the comment.  
These should be used to explain what is going on with specific lines of code.  

Example Comment:  
```
# This is a Comment.
```
##Documentation  
Documentation in python can be written with ''' or """ followed by the documentation and closed with ''' or """.
These should be used to tell the user what the class or function does.
It should also tell what the parameters and returns are if applicable.

Example Doc String 1:  
```
"""This is a Doc String
    You can type more here.
"""
```

Example Doc String 2:  
```
'''This is another Doc String.
   You can type more here.
'''
```

##Spacing  
Python defines blocks for functions or classes with spacing.  
It accepts both tabs or spaces for creating these blocks, but it is important to not mix tabs with spaces. A good rule is to never use tabs or to change tabs to spaces. For this tutorial all spacing will be 4.

Example Function:
```
def function:
    print "This is a function"
```

Note that if indentation levels occur from the compiler but the code looks like it has the same level of spaces, then the code probably mixed tabs with spaces.

##Object Format
For most of Python, everything can be thought of as an Object.  
The reason I say this is because even datatypes have functions or methods.  

Example Integer:
```
```
