Download and Install  \r\n2. Syntax  \r\n3. Built-in Datatypes  \r\n4. Functions  \r\n5. Using Libraries  \r\n6. Classes  \r\n\r\n##Download and Install  \r\nPython is usually pre-installed on Linux or Mac OSes. If it is not installed or you are using Windows, then you will need to download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org).  \r\n\r\n1. Go to the download page from [python.org](https://www.python.org).  \r\n   Or, go directly to the downloads page [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads).  \r\n\r\n2. Find the version of python you wish to install.  \r\n   For this tutorial, we will be using python2.7.10. But you should install the latest version for python2.7.  \r\n   Also note that I prefer to install the 32-bit compiler because it supports most of the python libraries.  \r\n\r\n3. Run the installer after downloading it.\r\n \r\n4. Install pip from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing).  \r\n   Note that Linux users may also need to install the python-dev package.   \r\n\r\n5. Install ScyPy Stack  \r\n   Download each package:  \r\n  * numpy  \r\n  * scipy  \r\n  * matplotlib  \r\n  * ipython  \r\n  * pandas  \r\n  * sympy  \r\n  * nose  \r\n\r\n   Note that this can also be installed as a bundled package.  \r\n   Check [here](www.scipy.org/install.html) for details.  \r\n   A recommended option is [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  \r\n   Also note that if you decide to download a bundled package, then you will also install their python compiler. Because of this, you can choose to skip steps 1 through 4.  \r\n\r\nNote that all python files have the .py extension. In order to run a file ie. example.py, you need to use the command \"python example.py\" in the console.\r\n\r\n##Syntax  \r\nPython syntax is fairly easy. The main issue occurs with indents and spaces. For this tutorial, tabs are replaced with 4 spaces. Another important note is that Python does not declare datatypes.\r\nThis section will cover:\r\n* if-else\r\n* loops\r\n* comments\r\n* documentation\r\n* spacing\r\n* object format\r\n   \r\n##Built-in Datatypes  \r\nPython supports a variety of datatypes without the need to declare them. \r\nThis section will cover the standard datatypes:  \r\n* numbers  \r\n* strings  \r\n* lists  \r\n* tuples  \r\n* dictionary  \r\n* sets  \r\n\r\n##Functions  \r\nPython functions are simple to implement. However it is important to note that the function must be defined before the function is called in the code.  \r\nThis section will cover:  \r\n* defining a function  \r\n* passing function arguments  \r\n* passing a function as an argument  \r\n* lambda functions  \r\n\r\n##Using Libraries  \r\nPython has many built-in libraries that already are installed, but you can also download and install additional libraries. All libraries are imported in python the same way.  \r\nThis section will cover:  \r\n* importing libraries  \r\n* checking library features  \r\n\r\n##Classes  \r\nPython classes are simple and easy to create. One interesting note is that python classes do not necessarily have a private feature (the privacy of a class is implied).  \r\nThis section will cover:  \r\n* defining a class  \r\n* encapsulation  \r\n* inheritance  \r\n* polymorphism  \r\n* overloading  \r\n\r\n##Tips  \r\nThis is a general list of tips.  \r\n1. PATHS  \r\n2. DOCS  \r\n3. OBJECTS  \r\n4. SANDBOX  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
