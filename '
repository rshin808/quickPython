4. Functions
5. Using Libraries
6. Classes

##Download and Install
Python is usually pre-installed on Linux or Mac OSes. If it is not installed or you are using Windows, then you will need to download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

1. Go to the download page from [python.org](https://www.python.org).
   Or, go directly to the downloads page [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads).
2. Find the version of python you wish to install.
   For this tutorial, we will be using python2.7.10. But you should install the latest version for python2.7.
   Also note that I prefer to install the 32-bit compiler because it supports most of the python libraries.

3. Run the installer after downloading it.

Additional Steps:
4. Install pip from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing)
   Note that Linux users may also need to install the python-dev package.

5. Install ScyPy Stack
   Download each package:
   * numpy
   * scipy
   * matplotlib
   * ipython
   * pandas
   * sympy
   * nose

   Note that this can also be installed as a bundled package.
   Check [here](www.scipy.org/install.html) for details.
   A recommended option is [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
   Also note that if you decide to download a bundled package, then you will also install their python compiler. Because of this, you can choose to skip steps 1 through 4.
