#Quick Python Tutorial  
##Overview  
This is a tutorial to cover some Python basics.  
For more detailed information, read the documentation from [here](https://docs.python.org/2/) 

1. Download and Install  
2. Syntax  
3. Built-in Datatypes  
4. Functions  
5. Using Libraries  
6. Classes  

##Download and Install  
Python is usually pre-installed on Linux or Mac OSes. If it is not installed or you are using Windows, then you will need to download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org).  

1. Go to the download page from [python.org](https://www.python.org).  
   Or, go directly to the downloads page [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads).  

2. Find the version of python you wish to install.  
   For this tutorial, we will be using python2.7.10. But you should install the latest version for python2.7.  
   Also note that I prefer to install the 32-bit compiler because it supports most of the python libraries.  

3. Run the installer after downloading it.
 
4. Install pip from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing).  
   Note that Linux users may also need to install the python-dev package.   

5. Install ScyPy Stack  
   Download each package:  
  * numpy  
  * scipy  
  * matplotlib  
  * ipython  
  * pandas  
  * sympy  
  * nose  

   Note that this can also be installed as a bundled package.  
   Check [here](www.scipy.org/install.html) for details.  
   A recommended option is [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  
   Also note that if you decide to download a bundled package, then you will also install their python compiler. Because of this, you can choose to skip steps 1 through 4.  

##Running Python Code
All python files have the .py extension. In order to run a file ie. example.py, you need to use the command "python example.py" in the console.

Example Helloworld.py:
Note this needs to be run from the command-line.
```
python Helloworld.py
```

##Syntax    
Python syntax is fairly easy. The main issue occurs with indents and spaces. For this tutorial, tabs are replaced with 4 spaces. Another important note is that Python does not declare datatypes.
This section will cover:
* if-else
* loops
* comments
* documentation
* spacing
* object format
   
##Built-in Datatypes    
Python supports a variety of datatypes without the need to declare them. 
This section will cover the standard datatypes:  
* numbers  
* strings  
* lists  
* tuples  
* dictionary  
* sets  

##Functions  
Python functions are simple to implement. However it is important to note that the function must be defined before the function is called in the code.  
This section will cover:  
* defining a function  
* passing function arguments  
* passing a function as an argument  
* lambda functions  

##Using Libraries  
Python has many built-in libraries that already are installed, but you can also download and install additional libraries. All libraries are imported in python the same way.  
This section will cover:  
* importing libraries  
* checking library features  

##Classes  
Python classes are simple and easy to create. One interesting note is that python classes do not necessarily have a private feature (the privacy of a class is implied).  
This section will cover:  
* defining a class  
* encapsulation  
* inheritance  
* polymorphism  
* overloading
